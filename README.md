# hw3passwordgenerator

In this homework assignment, we created a password generator. 

The first step is to click the "Generate Password" button

The generator will then give you options with sequencial prompt messages to choose both how many characters you want your password to be; along with what types of characters you want in your password. 

Password character length must be: 8 - 128 characters.  (No less than 8, and no more than 128)

The options of characters to include in your password are:
1. Uppercase Letters
2. Lowercase Letters
3. Numbers
4. Special Characters

Once you have gone through the prompts, and selected what criteria you would like in your password, your new password will appear in the generator window. 

Enjoy!
