# hw3passwordgenerator

In this homework assignment, we created a password generator. 

The generator gives you options with sequencial prompt messages to choose what types of characters you want in your password. 

The options of characters to include in your password are:
1. Uppercase Letters
2. Lowercase Letters
3. Numbers
4. Special Characters

Once you have gone through the prompts, and selected what criteria you would like in your password, your new password will appear in the generator window. 

Enjoy!
